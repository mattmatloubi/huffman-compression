# huffman-compression

this program takes in an input .txt file, constructs a huffman compression tree and outputs each character's huffman encoding, as well as calculating the compression rate
compatible with both unix/dos line breaks

see the example below, where the input is chapter 1 of K&R:\
the binary string is the encoding, followed by it's length, then the frequency of the character\
expectation is that characters with the highest frequency of occurance have the shortest encodings
